          <h1>The Coffee break community</h1>
          <br>
          <h3>Present your it-project and develop together</h3>
          Coffee break is the meeting place and playroom where ideas start and maybe outgrow to next generation world-conquering products and services. Coffee Break is a open source community web page that aims to serve as a collaboration and sharing platform among students and teachers at the IT-Högskolan, IT University college, in Gothenburg. The idea of the site is to encourage community activities on school or personal projects, learn from eachother and enjoy the benefits of networking. This community has its roots at "IT-Högskolan", Gothenburg but also welcomes any contributors, developers, designers, scrum masters, marketing specialists and area specialists, you name it, who feel this community is interesting. We look forward to see crossfunctional teams with different skillsets who like to engourage eachother. As Coding is caring we are ready to fail, we are ready to success.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Get involved</h3>
          If you are interested in getting involved and do not know where to start you are welcome to check out our meeting schedule or contact the school or the coffee break team, <a id="contenttext" href"#">contact</a>.
          If you like to get your hands dirty with remote collaborating and "githubbing" you are welcome to look at our <a id="contenttext" href"#">projects</a>. To get clues on how to present your ideas to the community you can check out the Coffee Break projects <a id="contenttext" href"#">"read me"</a> sections and go ahead on designing how to present your own ideas to the community.
          <br>
          <br>
          Here is a couple of links and examples on how to get involved. For this Coffee Break website development we used Atom as the editor and here are some info on integrating Atom to Github and the work flow when pulling latest verisons and pushing new code.
          <br>
          - Clone project to local folder and create Atom integration: <a id="contenttext"  href="

          <br>
          - Using Atom and Github via Terminal:

          <br>
          - Open Source community: <a id="contenttext" href="

          <br>
          <br>
          Welcome also to cooperate on building this site that is built on basic web technologies: Html, Css, Javascript and uses Jquery. Let's build this webpage to a welcoming environment where people meet and take ideas forward.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>For companies</h3>
          We warmly welcome companies and other organisations who would like to get involved with the schools highly potential community. Wheather it is a hypothetical idea for a company to develop some services, a startup proposal or any suggestion on development we are interested to open a dialogue and look for partnerships or start paralell projects. We can synergize about open source or private projects. Each student also has a LIA, "Learning in work" period that is included in the studies, thus this gives a great opportunity for companies and the school to collaborate even closer together. Coffee break is a bridge towards companies who want to synergize with the schools staff and students who are becoming professionals within programs including mobile development, web development, .net development and software testing.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Private ideas</h3>
          As the school sometimes also gets proposals on business ideas from individuals who are looking for developer students for partnership projects then Coffee Break is also a good medium to approach for this kind of proposals. This would also include ideas and partnerships that might build up between students. Many times it might be good to be a couple more buddies to work forward on complex solutions.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>About us</h3>
          Coffee Break was initiated by two students, Patrik Rikama Hinnenberg and Eric Groseclos Wikås who started to hang out every monday in the classroom after the lecture hours. The foundations of the initiative was the passion for coding, a will to play and do stuff together and a gut feeling and hyphothesis that this kind of community could have great potential.
          <br>
          <br>
          IT-Högskolan is a IT-school in Gothenburg, Sweden. The school is driven by IT and education professionals.
