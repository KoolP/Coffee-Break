# Coffee-Break
<h3>Present your it-project to fellow students and build them together.</h3>
Coffee Break is a open source community web page that aims to serve as a collaboration and sharing platform among students and teachers at IT-Högskolan Gothenburg. Let's build this webpage to a welcoming environment where people meet and take ideas forward. The idea is to encourage community activities on school or personal projects, learn from eachother and enjoy the benefits of networking. Coffee break is the meeting place and playroom where ideas start and maybe outgrow to next generation world-conquering products and services. This project is intented for the benefit of "IT-Högskolan", Gothenburg but also welcomes any contributors, developers and companies who like to get involved with the IT schools exiting and highly potential environment. Welcome to share knowledge, contribute and become stronger together.

Coffee Break was started by a couple of students at IT-högskolan during year 2017 who wanted to stay in school after the lectures and believed that we need to play more together.
