# Coffee-Break
<h3>Present your it-project to fellow students and build things together.</h3>
Coffee Break is a open source community web page that aims to serve as a collaboration and sharing platform among students and teachers at IT-Högskolan Gothenburg. The idea is to collaborate on school projects or any other ideas, learn from eachother and enjoy the benefits of networking. Coffee break is the meeting place and playroom where ideas start and maybe outgrow to next generation world-conquering products and services. The page project is intented for the benefit of "IT-Högskolan", Gothenburg but also welcomes other developers and companies. Welcome to share knowledge, contribute and become stronger together.
