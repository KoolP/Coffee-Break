# Coffee-Break
<h3>Present your it-project to fellow students and build them together.</h3>
Coffee Break is a open source community web page that aims to serve as a collaboration and sharing platform among students and teachers at the IT-Högskolan, IT University college, in Gothenburg. Let's build this webpage to a welcoming environment where people meet and take ideas forward. The idea of the site is to encourage community activities on school or personal projects, learn from eachother and enjoy the benefits of networking. Coffee break is the meeting place and playroom where ideas start and maybe outgrow to next generation world-conquering products and services. This project is intended for the benefit of "IT-Högskolan", Gothenburg but also welcomes any contributors, developers and companies who like to get involved with the schools exiting and highly potential community. This project aims to build networks among the students and teachers and a bridge towards companies who want to synergize with the schools students that are studying to become professionals within programs including mobiledevelopment, web development, .net development and test-technologies.

<h3>About us</h3>
Coffee Break was started by two students, Patrik Rikama Hinnenberg and Eric Groseclos Wikås who started to hang out every monday in the classroom after the lecture hours. We believe that we need to play more together to further our development. The foundations of this initiative was a hyphothesis on the community possibilities and a gut feeling that collaborating is more fun, just like when making food together.
